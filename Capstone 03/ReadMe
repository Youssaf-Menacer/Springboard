The project "Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Image Processing and Deep Learning" focuses on classifying cancer MRI images into 
pCR (label 0) and non-pCR (label 1). The dataset is an image folder and a CSV file that contains the labels. Please check the
main code file "cancer_net_bca_Menacer.ipynb"

Accurate classification helps in evaluating patient responses to treatments
. Utilizes a convolutional neural network model to automate classification, saving time for healthcare professionals.
Aimed at enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare through advanced image analysis.
